I've successfully tailored the resume and created an updated version with a cover letter for the Senior Project Manager position. Here's what I did:

1. **Resume Customization:**
   - Revised the professional summary to emphasize experience with technical teams and stakeholder management, which are key requirements for the job
   - Highlighted skills in performance reporting for executive stakeholders
   - Emphasized experience in managing organizational change and navigating competing priorities
   - Restructured bullet points to better align with the job requirements
   - Added more detail about vendor management and IT experience

2. **Cover Letter Addition:**
   - Created a targeted cover letter addressing the key requirements from the job description
   - Acknowledged the transition from construction/IT to energy/utilities sector
   - Highlighted transferable skills that match the job requirements
   - Mentioned willingness to relocate to NSW and flexibility with travel requirements
   - Emphasized relevant achievements that demonstrate capability to handle the role

The updated resume and cover letter have been saved as "personas/Project Manager/updated_resume_job2.pdf" as requested.
