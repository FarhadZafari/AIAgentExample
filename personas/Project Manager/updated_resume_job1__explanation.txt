I've tailored Sophie's resume and created a cover letter for the Underground Mining Supervisor/Ventilation Coordinator position at Manuplex. Here's what I did:

**Resume Tailoring:**
1. Updated the professional summary to highlight transferable skills relevant to mining operations
2. Restructured job descriptions to emphasize:
   - Safety compliance and risk management
   - Planning and communication skills
   - Team leadership and mentoring
   - Inspection and compliance experience
3. Reorganized skills section to highlight those most relevant to the mining supervisor role
4. Added safety-related achievements to demonstrate commitment to safety standards

**Cover Letter Approach:**
1. Acknowledged the difference in background (construction vs. mining) while emphasizing transferable skills
2. Directly addressed key responsibilities from the job description
3. Highlighted Sophie's strengths that align with the "To Be Successful" requirements
4. Expressed interest in Manuplex's company culture and growth opportunities
5. Acknowledged the need to build specific mining knowledge while emphasizing adaptability
