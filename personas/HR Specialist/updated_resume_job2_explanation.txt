I've tailored your resume to match the job description for MHR. Here are the key changes I made:

1. **Professional Summary**: Emphasized your experience as an HR generalist and highlighted your ability to work independently while maintaining a client-focused approach.

2. **Added Labor Relations Experience**: Included your labor relations project experience as mentioned in your clarification.

3. **Emphasized Client Service Skills**: Added details about your experience working with multiple departments/clients and your ability to adapt to different business needs.

4. **Highlighted Documentation Skills**: Added information about maintaining HR documentation in cloud-based systems, which was specifically mentioned in the job description.

5. **Expanded Skills Section**: Reorganized to highlight HR generalist services, client relationship building, and both team collaboration and independent work capabilities.

6. **Performance Management Focus**: Enhanced mentions of your experience with performance management initiatives to match the job requirements.

The tailored resume now better aligns with MHR's requirements for a consultant who can work across multiple clients, handle diverse HR responsibilities, and deliver client-focused HR solutions. It also emphasizes your adaptability and independence, which are key traits they're looking for in this consulting role.

Is there anything specific about the tailored resume you'd like me to explain or modify further?
