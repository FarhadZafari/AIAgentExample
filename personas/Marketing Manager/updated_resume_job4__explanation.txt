I've successfully tailored Sarah Chen's resume for the Marketing & Communications Specialist position at Leed. Here are the key changes I made:

1. **Updated the Professional Summary**: Repositioned Sarah as a "Marketing & Communications Specialist" rather than just a "Marketing Manager" and emphasized her communication skills, content creation abilities, and brand management experience.

2. **Restructured Experience Bullets**: Highlighted responsibilities and achievements that align with the job description's key requirements:
   - Communication strategy development
   - Digital channel management
   - Content production for various audiences
   - Brand voice protection and consistency
   - Support for proposals/submissions
   - Storytelling about company initiatives

3. **Refined Skills Section**: Organized skills into categories that directly match what Leed is seeking:
   - Communications skills
   - Digital platform expertise
   - Strategic planning capabilities
   - Relevant tools

4. **Added Achievement**: Included an achievement about developing brand voice guidelines to demonstrate her experience in maintaining consistent messaging.

5. **Emphasized Relevant Experience**: Highlighted her ability to manage multiple priorities simultaneously, which was specifically mentioned in the job requirements.

The resume now presents Sarah as an ideal candidate who can deliver the impactful communication and brand management that Leed is seeking for this role.
